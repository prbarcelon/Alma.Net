# Alma.Net
ALMA can allow game developers to add real-time emotions and moods to Non Player Characters (NPC).

It integrates three major affective characteristics: emotions, moods, and personality that cover short, medium, and long term affect.

Alma.Net is a C# implementation of the affect computation from ALMA - A Layered Model of Affect by Patrick Gebhard https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1082473.1082478
